        <ul>
          <li><span class="year">1904</span> - Born in Amsterdam to a musical family</li>
          <li><span class="year">1914</span> - Began her study of the cello</li>
          <li><span class="year">1921</span> - Made her professional debut in the Kleine Zaal recital hall of the Concertgebouw at age 17, assisted at the piano by her father. Her father died a few months after. </li>
          <li><span class="year">1937</span> - Became the first woman in Europe to be artistic director and conductor of an ongoing professional orchestral ensemble, Het Klein Orkest. Belinfante held this position until 1941.</li>
          <li><span class="year">1941</span> - Became actively involved with the resistance movement, mainly by forging personal documents for Jews and others wanted by the Gestapo.</li>
          <li><span class="year">1943</span> - She was part of the CKC resistance group that organised and executed the bombing of the population registry in Amsterdam, which destroyed thousands of files and hindered Nazi attempts to compare forged documents with documents in the registry.</li>
          <li><span class="year">1943</span> - After the bombing, Belinfante was forced to go into hiding. She  disguised herself as a man and lived with friends for 3 months before being traced by the Nazis.</li>
          <li><span class="year">1947</span> - Belinfante emigrated to the United States, eventually settling in Laguna Beach, California and joining the music faculty of UCLA in 1949.</li>

          <li><span class="year">1962</span> - Belinfante's involvement with the Orange County Philharmonic came to an abrupt end when her contract was not renewed. Financial pressures had been mounting because the musicians' union wanted the players to be paid for rehearsals. Additionally, board members and supporters from the community felt a male conductor would raise the stature of the orchestra and increase revenue.</li>
          <li><span class="year">1987</span> - The Orange County Board of Supervisors and the City of Laguna Beach both declared February 19 'Frieda Belinfante Day", honoring her contributions to musical culture in the region.</li>
