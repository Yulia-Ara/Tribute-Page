# Tribute to Frieda Belinfante

I'm a big fan of the podcast [Stuff You Missed in History Class](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/stuff-you-missed-in-history-cl-21124503/). A recent episode on Frieda Belinfante had me in awe.

This is my simple tribute to this incredible woman and human being. 

This is also my way of brushing up on HTML and CSS after a long break from learning.

Enjoy!
